## @twtfu: martial arts on twitter
@twtfu is a Twitter bot that mediates martial arts-style "battles" between
Twitter users. I wrote it to learn Ruby and the Twitter API, as well as play
around with MongoDB.

At this time, @twtfu is no longer active (my AWS trial expired, booo), but feel
free to check out [the Twitter account](https://twitter.com/twtfu) and
[the Tumblr site](http://twtfu.tumblr.com).
